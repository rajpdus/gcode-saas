# Agent Plan: Step 1 - Define Problem & Target Audience

## 1. Goal

To elicit, clarify, and formally define the core problem the SaaS application intends to solve and identify the primary target audience. This foundational understanding guides all subsequent design and development steps.

## 2. Input

*   User's initial, potentially vague, idea or description of the desired application.

## 3. Primary Agent(s) Involved

*   **`OrchestratorAgent`**: Leads the interaction with the user.
*   **(Optional) `RequirementsAgent`**: A potential specialized agent focused solely on requirement elicitation and analysis, assisting the Orchestrator. (For this plan, we'll assume the `OrchestratorAgent` handles this directly for simplicity).

## 4. Process / Workflow

1.  **Initiation:** The user provides their initial application concept to the `OrchestratorAgent`.
2.  **Problem Clarification:** The `OrchestratorAgent` engages in an interactive dialogue (Q&A) with the user to:
    *   Drill down into the specific pain points the application addresses.
    *   Understand the core value proposition.
    *   Identify the key outcomes the user expects from the application.
    *   Distinguish essential features (MVP) from nice-to-haves.
3.  **Audience Identification:** The `OrchestratorAgent` prompts the user to describe the intended users:
    *   Who are they (roles, demographics if relevant)?
    *   What are their technical skills?
    *   What are their primary goals when using the application?
4.  **Summarization & Confirmation:** The `OrchestratorAgent` synthesizes the gathered information into structured statements:
    *   A concise **Problem Statement**.
    *   A clear description of the **Target Audience** and their needs.
    *   A high-level list of **Core Objectives/Features** derived from the problem statement.
5.  **User Validation:** The `OrchestratorAgent` presents the summarized statements back to the user for confirmation or refinement. This loop continues until the user agrees with the defined scope.

## 5. Output

*   **Validated Problem Statement:** A clear, concise description of the problem being solved.
*   **Target Audience Profile:** A description of the intended users and their key characteristics/goals.
*   **High-Level Core Objectives/Features:** A bulleted list outlining the main goals the application must achieve to solve the stated problem for the target audience.

## 6. Best Practices / Constraints Enforcement

*   Focus on clarity and avoiding ambiguity.
*   Encourage the user to think in terms of problems and user needs rather than just features.
*   Keep the scope focused, especially for the initial generation (MVP).
*   The output serves as the primary input for the `ArchitectureAgent` in the next step.
